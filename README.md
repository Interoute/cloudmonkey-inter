# cloudmonkey-interoute

This is a fork of the Cloudmonkey command line interface, modified for use with the [Interoute Virtual Data Centre](http://cloudstore.interoute.com/main/WhatInterouteVDC).

The modification required is to handle API access to the different VDC regions (Europe, USA, Asia). This is implemented using a new configuration variable 'region'. 

The default value is 'Europe'. Note that the master version of Cloudmonkey can access the default region without modification.
