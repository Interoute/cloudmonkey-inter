Apache CloudStack CloudMonkey Changelog
---------------------------------------

(2014-10-15) INTEROUTE FORK OF VERSION 5.2.0
============================================
A modification is required for using Cloudmonkey with Interoute Virtual Data Centre. This is to handle access
to the different VDC regions, by creating a new configuration variable 'region'.
The files cloudmonkey.py, requester.py and config.py have been modified.

Version 5.2.0
=============
This release includes
 - In the config [server] section is deprecated now
 - For missing keys, cloudmonkey will set default values
 - Network requests, json decoding and shell related bugfixes
 - Based on platform, it will install either pyreadline (Windows) or readline (OSX and Linux)
 - Config options `protocol`, `host`, `port`, `path` are deprecated now
 - Backward compatibilty exists for above options but we use `url` for the mgmt server URL
 - Introduces server profiles so users can use cloudmonkey with different hosts and management server configs
 - A default profile under the section [local] is added with default values
 - Everytime `set` is called, cloudmonkey will write the config and reload config file

Make sure you backup your config before you upgrade cloudmonkey from previous releases.
With this release `cloudmonkey` will automatically fix your config file, add missing
configuration parameters and save it as the upgraded versions starts for the first time.

Version 5.1.0
=============
This release includes
 - support for using username and password instead of / in addition to api key and secret key
 - Usage of signature version 3 for the api signing process. This reduces the chance of API replay attacks
 - cleanup based on reporting from PEP8 and Flake8

If you upgrade from 5.0, then cloudmonkey will ask you to update your config file (~/.cloudmonkey/config)
Under the [user], you can add
username =
password =
Under the [server], you can add
expires = 600

Version 5.0.0
=============
This is the first release of CloudMonkey independent from the Apache CloudStack core orchestration engine. The release
includes a precache of Apache CloudStack 4.2.0 API calls, and should be backward compatible with prior 3.x and 4.x
CloudStack installations (with the obvious caveat that previous versions will have a subset of the latest API commands /
parameters).
